# Schoolsoft-redesign


## Why Schoolsoft?
  We chose to redesign schoolsoft because we disliked their user friendliness and design, due to them * *almost* * not having **ANY** responsive design at all (Image 1 is on 100% laptop screen, Image2 is on large TV).
  They also decided to have a link for **EACH** diffrent possible thing, such as schedule and calendar being two diffrent links for no appearent reason

## Navbar

## Main-page

## Schedule

## Lunch Table
  Schoolsoft did not have a page for viewing the current food being served in the school so we chose to add it as a page in schoolsoft because its one of the most **desired** pages for students, where we also added the possibility to add 
  images of food groups and information surrounding it like country of origin and if its vegan or made of pork

## Prencence
  Schoolsoft had **three** diffrent links (image 1) for checking your precence and reporting your abstence (image 2,3,4), so we decided to combine them to one united page for easier navigation where we also made it responsive for easier viewing on small devices (image 5) as well as on large ones (image 6)
